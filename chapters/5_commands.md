# Commands

Linux has a vast array of commands, the Linux philosophy is such that each program does a very trivial thing on it's own, yet, can be piped together to create complex functionality. A great way to check commands if you are unsure is to read through the Help and manual entries. I have listed a few of the more common commands you will use below.
